  We usually split the data into training data and test data. The training set contains a known output and the model learns on this data in order to be generalized
  to other data later on.
  
  We have the test dataset (or subset) in order to test our model's prediction on this subset. 
  
  We will do this using the scikit-learn library and specifically the train_test_split method
