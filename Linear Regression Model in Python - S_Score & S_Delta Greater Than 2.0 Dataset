  We usually split the data into training data and test data. The training set contains a known output and the model learns on this data in order to be generalized
  to other data later on.
  
  We have the test dataset (or subset) in order to test our model's prediction on this subset. 
  
  We will do this using the scikit-learn library and specifically the train_test_split method

Model Validation:
      We created a model using the training data, used it to predict outcomes on a split segment of test data 
      then will use a scoring method to determine a measure of effectiveness (mean squared error) of the model on the testing data.
      
      This gives us an approximation of how well the model will perform on other similar datasets

5-fold cross-validation:

      Cross-validation is a vital step in evaluating a model. It maximizes the amount of data that is used to train the model, as during the course 
      of training, the model is not only trained, but also tested on all of the available data.
      
      Here we will use 5-fold cross validation on the data. By default, scikit-learn's  cross_val_score() function uses R2 as the metric of choice
      for regression. Sicne we are performing a 5-fold cross-validation, the function will return 5 scores. 
      
      We will compare these 5 scores and then take their average.
