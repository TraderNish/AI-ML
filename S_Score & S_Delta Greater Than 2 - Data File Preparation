Exploraratory Data Analysis

  1. shape attribute will show us the shape(dimensionality) of the data - number of columns and rows
  2. info() method will display all columns and their data types:
        Object data type often means (catch-all for columns that pandas doesn't recognize as any other specific types) that all of the values in the columns are strings
  3. head() method will give us an idea about top 5 rows.
  4. We can configure pandas to display all columns, with 2 decimal places like this:
        pd.set_option("display.max.columms", 2)
  5. describe() method will provide the descriptive statistics summary (an overview of the values each column contains)
        Min, Max, Count, etc.
        .describe() only analyzes numeric columns by default, but you can provide other data types if you use the include parameter:
        df.describe(include = np.object)
   6. you can examine how often specific values occur in a column by .value_counts() method
